## üìö What I Learned

Throughout this project, I gained extensive hands-on experience and a deep understanding of the full game development pipeline. As a solo developer, I was responsible for every aspect of the production, which significantly strengthened both my technical and creative capabilities. Key areas of learning include:
Designing, planning, and documenting a complete game using structured development practices
Crafting a detailed Game Design Document to guide production and maintain vision consistency
Enhancing my critical thinking and problem-solving skills through independent research and implementation
Creating and rigging custom characters, including asset integration and animation setup
Implementing and retargeting character animations across different skeleton structures using Unreal's IK Rig system
Designing and generating open-world maps with immersive environments using painting tools and World Machine
Developing stylized character clothing with Marvelous Designer and Blender
Adding and interacting with animals like horses and camels to enrich gameplay
Building and scripting interactive NPCs with behavior logic and dialogue support
Implementing complex game systems like Travel mechanics, Combat system, Quest system (combat-based and location-based)
Creating intelligent AI using Behavior Trees, blackboards, and class inheritance
Mastering MetaSounds for audio design and implementing dynamic soundscapes
Utilizing the Niagara system to create responsive visual effects
Building cinematic cutscenes using storyboard-style panels for storytelling
Designing and implementing UI systems, including main menu, pause menu, settings, and quest tracker
Creating a save/load system to preserve player progress and preferences
Successfully building, packaging, and deploying the game for future distribution
This project not only taught me technical skills but also sharpened my ability to plan, iterate, adapt, and deliver a complete, playable experience under real-world constraints. It has prepared me to take on more ambitious projects and contribute meaningfully in professional game development environments.
